Assigned Task: Landing Page using HTML and CSS
The assigned task involves creating a landing page using HTML and CSS. The goal is to design an engaging and visually appealing webpage that effectively communicates a message or purpose.

My Approach
For this task, I followed a structured approach to design a clean and responsive landing page. The key elements of my approach include:

HTML Structure:

Developed a well-organized HTML structure with semantic tags.
Ensured accessibility and readability for better user experience.
CSS Styling:

Applied CSS styles to enhance the visual appeal of the landing page.
Utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout design and responsiveness.
Ensured a consistent color scheme and typography for a cohesive look.
Responsive Design:

Implemented responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
Used media queries to adapt the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
Optimization:

Optimized images and other assets for faster page loading.
Ensured cross-browser compatibility for a seamless user experience.
Repository Structure
index.html: Main HTML file for the landing page.
styles.css: CSS file containing the styling rules. Task2 To-do List: This is a simple web-based TODO list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks from their to-do list. Users can mark tasks as completed, sort them by priority, and search for specific tasks. It uses local storage to store the user's tasks, so they don't have to worry about losing their data. This project is a great starting point for those who want to learn web development or want to build their own task management application.
